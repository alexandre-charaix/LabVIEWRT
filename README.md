# LabVIEWRT
Welcome to our LabVIEW RT M2 project

This project occurs during our last year at ISEN Engineering school in the embedded system specialization.

*The aim of the project is to create a spirit level with a myRIO embedded system.*

## Members :shipit:
- MINHONNAC Antoine
- VACCARO Jérémy
- CHARAIX Alexandre

## Requirements
- [X] Create a spirit level with the myRIO accelerometer and leds. #1
- [X] Create a condition where we let the opportunity to the user to record and save the current myRIO position data into one of its internal files. #2
- [X] Create a condition where we allow the user to modify the 0° reference according to a saved data recorded thanks to a button (a chase will be shown thanks to the leds). #3
- [X] Create a condition where we let the user reset the current state of the myRIO and showing it by switching on all leds present in the myRIO. #4 
- [ ] Create an executable of our program. #5
- [ ] Create a windows VI that can interact with the myRIO and that does all the precedent steps. #6


*Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, we'll be pleased to answer you accordingly.*
